Marcus came across some new intel yesterday about why reports have been coming in that robots
have been mobilizing across the state. He was scheduled to go on a broadcast today on the Sunshine
Free Radio, a rebel-run radio and information station, but no one has heard from them.

I'm going to act on his intel - I'm going to start with exploring the ruins east of our base (what
was previously Universal Studios, or so I'm told), there were reports of Overlord movements into the area,
but if he's right about this, this needs to be done. I can't speak too much now ... you never know
who is listening.

Here's the intel I can share about the situation (https://github.com/ShiftCreatorSpace/cyberphunk),
if you're reading this anon - humankind's fate might be in your hands.

Talk soon.
